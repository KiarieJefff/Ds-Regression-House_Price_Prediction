    "\n",
    "In accordance with CRISP-DM, the Data Understanding phase confirms that the dataset's missing values are **intentional, interpretable, and business-relevant**, providing a strong foundation for the subsequent Data Preparation and Modeling phases. The insights gained directly inform the design and implementation of the structured `src` modules for reproducible and maintainable data science workflows."
