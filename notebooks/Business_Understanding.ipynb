    "# 1. Business Understanding\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.1 Business Context\n",
    "\n",
    "The residential real estate market is highly competitive and price-sensitive. Property values are influenced by a combination of structural attributes (e.g., size, number of rooms), locational factors (e.g., neighborhood, proximity to amenities), and market dynamics.\n",
    "\n",
    "Real estate firms and property developers rely heavily on experience and manual comparisons to price properties. This approach is often inconsistent, subjective, and slow to adapt to changing market conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a result, properties are frequently mispriced, leading to extended listing periods or unrealized revenue.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.2 Business Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "The company currently lacks a standardized, data-driven mechanism for estimating the fair market value of residential properties prior to listing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key challenges include:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Inconsistent pricing across similar properties\n",
    "* Over-reliance on agent intuition\n",
    "* Limited ability to quantify the impact of property features on price\n",
    "* Revenue loss due to underpricing\n",
    "* Increased holding and marketing costs due to overpricing\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.3 Business Objective\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary objective is to **develop a predictive pricing system** that estimates residential property prices accurately using historical sales data and property characteristics.\n",
    "\n",
    "The model should:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Provide reliable price estimates for new listings\n",
    "* Identify key drivers of housing prices\n",
    "* Support pricing decisions with quantifiable evidence\n",
    "* Improve pricing consistency across agents and locations\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.4 Stakeholders\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Real Estate Management**\n",
    "  Uses insights to define pricing strategies and monitor performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Sales Agents**\n",
    "  Uses predicted prices as a benchmark during client negotiations.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Property Developers / Investors**\n",
    "  Evaluate profitability of acquisition and renovation decisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Clients (Buyers & Sellers)**\n",
    "  Benefit indirectly through fair and transparent pricing.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.5 Data Mining Goal (Analytics Translation)\n",
    "\n",
    "Translate the business objective into an analytical task:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Task Type:** Supervised Learning – Regression\n",
    "* **Target Variable:** Sale Price\n",
    "* **Inputs:** Property attributes, location features, market indicators\n",
    "* **Output:** Continuous price prediction for each property\n",
